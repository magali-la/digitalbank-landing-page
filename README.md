## Welcome! 👋

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## My Process

Used TailwindCSS for the majority of styling and layout options and Bootstrap components for article card layout

Worked section by section to include structure, and later work on responsiveness per section including the nav and footer.

## Reflection 
One of the biggest challenges was dealing with the assignment constraints, I was to integrate aspects of Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap, which got tricky due to some overlap in the naming conventions. 
- To navigate these constraints, I mainly stuck with using arbitrary values for padding values that were in common with bootstrap. For example instead of using px or py with classic values, I included pl- and pr- which is exclusive to, then used pt- and pb- with arbitrary tailwind values
- It also included adjusting the order of bootstrap and tailwind in the head to place tailwind at the bottom

Additionally, if I had more time I would figure out how to get the background image in the hero section to scale, and incorporate javascript to implement a hamburger navigation.
